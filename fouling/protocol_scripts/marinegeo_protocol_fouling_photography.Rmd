## Introduction

This protocol provides standardized methods on how to best estimate percent cover via point counts from photographs taken of an entire fouling community.  

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

## Measured Parameters

- Percent cover of fouling panel communities
- Environmental parameters

\noindent\rule{\textwidth}{0.4pt}

## Requirements

Personnel: 1-2 people  

Estimated Total Time Per Location (*n* = 3 sites per habitat):  

|    Preparation: 1 person x 1 day
|    Field work: 1-2 people x 1 day per location
|    Data processing: 1 person x 5 days

*Estimated times will vary by site and conditions

Replication: At least three (3) sites per habitat, the number of habitats is decided by the partner site.

**Recommended Software**

Several programs are available to quantify percent cover and are listed below. The most useful program is CPCe, built for quantifying benthic cover though only available for Windows computers.  Training sessions can be made through MarineGEO for help with this and other programs.

## Methods

Fully review this and any additional protocols necessary for the sampling excursion. Address any questions or concerns to marinegeo@si.edu before beginning this protocol.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\underline{Preparation:}

1. Review the MarineGEO Fouling Community Survey Design for selection of permanent sites.
2. Become familiar with GPS equipment and test the device to make sure it works.
3. Deploy fouling panels in an artificial or benthic habitat **(see fouling community protocol)**

  \caption{Field photos of each colored tag and associated panel.}
\end{wrapfigure}

\underline{Fieldwork:}
Perform the following steps at 30, 60, and 90 days after the initial deployment.  

1. Record environmental measurements **(see environmental measurement protocol)**
2. Remove the panel from the water.  Shake any sediment off the panel. In clear water, it is acceptable to photograph panels in the water. **Panels do not need to be removed from PVC frame or bricks.**
3. First photograph the colored cable tie and then photograph the panel making sure the panel fills the entire camera frame.
4.  Take several photos of the panel to ensure at least one is in focus.
5.  If warranted, take photos of individual species to assist in identifications.
6. Return panel to the water.
7. When back at the lab, pick the best photo of each panel and relabel with the site_age_cabletiecolor. Organize photos by site and age.

1. Make sure photographs are labeled with names to indicate site_age_color.
    a. Site: acronym for the site 
    b. Age: either 30, 60, or 90 days 
    c. Color: color of cable tie used to identify each panel 
2. Photos should be cropped, and color corrected (if necessary) for light prior to analysis.
3. Place the photo in the program of choice.
4. Overlay a 100-point grid on the panel.  There are several methods on the distribution or arrangement of points.  It is recommended that either a stratified random assortment (random but still covers all of panel) of points be placed on the panel or in a uniform grid (see below).
5. Under each point, identify the species to the lowest possible taxonomic group.  A list of standardized taxonomic categories using the CATAMI scheme can also be used and found at https://catami.github.io/. If a point falls on sediment or open space, count that point as either sediment or open space.  If a point falls upon a species growing on top of another (e.g. barnacles on top of oyster), count the species that is on the upper most layer.  However, the user is encouraged to use their best judgement on what species should be counted that best reflects what is most dominant.
6.  Point counts from CPCe can be exported into an Excel workbook.  This is necessary to obtain point-count data, however it is necessary to further enter this data into the supplied data templates to be uploaded to MarineGEO.

## Data Submission

1. Scan the completed field data sheets and save both paper and electronic versions locally. We do not require you to submit the scanned forms.
2. Enter data into the provided data entry template. Each template is an Excel spreadsheet. Please provide as much protocol and sample metadata as possible, such as the protocol version and contact information. Use the “notes” columns to provide additional information or context if a relevant column doesn’t already exist, rather than renaming or creating columns.
3. Use our online submission portal to upload the Excel Spreadsheet: [https://marinegeo.github.io/data-submission](https://marinegeo.github.io/data-submission)
4. Contact us if you have any questions: [marinegeo@si.edu](mailto:marinegeo@si.edu)
