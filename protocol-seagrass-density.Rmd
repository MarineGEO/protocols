## Introduction

This protocol provides standardized data on seagrass percent cover, species composition, and shoot density using a common non-destructive method: the quadrat. Additional copies of this protocol, field datasheets, data entry templates, instructional videos, literature, and more can be found here: https://marinegeo.github.io/modules/seagrass-density.

## Measured Parameters

This assay quantifies seagrass community structure, measured as:

*	Percent cover of each seagrass and macroalgae species (0.25 m^-2^)
*	Macroinvertebrate abundance (number 0.25 m^-2^) and approximate size (cm)
*	Shoot density (number 0.0625 m^-2^)

\underline{Preparation:}

1. Review the MarineGEO [Seagrass Habitats Survey Design](https://marinegeo.github.io/seagrass) for site selection and setup. This protocol assumes *n* = 12 quadrats for percent cover taken every 4m and *n* = 6 shoot density counts taken every 8m along a 50-m transect, replicated along 3 separate transects.
2. Print field data sheets on waterproof paper. You will need at least 3 sheets but having more available is useful, especially when >1 seagrass species is present.
\vspace{\baselineskip}

\underline{Fieldwork:}

1. At each predetermined point along the transect where the sample is to be collected, lay down a quadrat immediately adjacent to the transect line. If visibility is too poor to perform a visual survey of percent cover, skip to step 5.
2. Estimate and record cover of the following in bins according to the Braun-Blanquet method  (Table 1):
      a. Each seagrass species;
      b. Other sessile organisms (e.g., macroalgae, sponges, etc.). Be as specific as you can in identifying these organisms but do not guess if you are unsure (e.g., record ‘red sponge’ not ‘Acarnus erithacus?’);
      c. Bare substratum. Note the type (e.g., sand, mud, mixed).

---- 

Acceptable methods for estimating cover include:

a.	Assign percentage bins (represented by letters) according to the modified Braun-Blanquet method^2^   described in Table 1
b.	Estimate cover to the nearest 5% bin
c.	Point count: using a quadrat fitted with a grid, record cover type under each grid intersection. Record the total number of points counted on your datasheet.

Be sure to record the **dimensions of your quadrat** and the **method used** (Braun-Blanquet, % bins, or point count) on your datasheet.

|    **Table 1.** Values of the modified Braun-Blanquet scale representing discrete percent cover bins.  Each letter of the modified bins corresponds to a number representing a bin from the Braun-Blaquet scale.  Please use letter bins in data entry spreadsheets to facilitate the MarineGEO data curation process.

Modified Braun-Blanquet Bin | Braun-Blanquet Bin |	Interpretation | Cover
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
A | 0	| Absent | 0%
B | 0.1	| A single shoot (1-2% cover) | < 5%
C | 0.5	| A few shoots (3-5% cover) | < 5%
D | 1 | Some cover | 5-25%
E | 2 | Moderate cover | 25-50%
F | 3 | Majority cover | 50-75%
G | 4 | Total or near total cover | 75-100%

3. Record the presence and approximate size of any large mobile benthic macroinvertebrates (>10 cm) that fall within the quadrat (e.g., gastropods, urchins, sea cucumbers).
4. In every *other* replicate, obtain a measurement of shoot density by counting and recording the number of seagrass shoots within a 25 x 25 cm quadrat (or other fixed area of appropriate size for your site) (**specify dimensions** on your datasheet) If visibility is poor, shoot density can be obtained by touch. Record shoot counts on the Seagrass Density datasheet.
5. If shoot densities cannot be assessed visually OR by touch, a biomass core can be used to destructively sample the bed and count shoot densities in the lab (see: Seagrass Biomass protocol). 
6. Repeat steps 1-5 for each replicate on the first transect.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for the remaining two transects.
